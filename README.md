# Craughwell Furniture website

At the core, this is a static website, generated by jekyll, hosted on Amazon AWS. There are a number of moving parts, however.

## Source Data
The source data is maintained by Craughwell Furniture.  
In a public Dropbox folder, they update an XLS file with the raw data for the Ranges pages and product pages.
The images required for the site are also maintained there, and removed and added as required.
The spreadsheet structure must not be altered.
To have linebreaks in the website a pipe "|" character must be used.

## Site Build

###Raw Data
- A bash script in /scripts pulls in the xls file, converts to csv files, one for ranges and one for products.  
- The pipe "|" characters are convereted to linebreaks.  
- The Source data has commas, with causes some issues, therefore the pipe seperator is used for the csv file used to generate pages
- Two versions of the cvsfiles are created.  
- One is sent to the app/_data folder for use as Jekyll variables. 
- One is used by another bash script to genenate .md files for use in building Jekyll pages. 
- Images are downloaded from Dropbox and placed in the media folder
