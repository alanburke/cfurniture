description: "As Ireland responds to one of the most challenging situations our country has ever encountered, we at Craughwell Furniture want to wish everyone good health and wellbeing. 

Our utmost priority is the health and safety of our customers, staff and the wider community during the current Covid-19 pandemic. The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has advised that it is important companies do their utmost to stay open during this difficult time and support their staff .

Therefore, from today, March 20, 2020, Craughwell Furniture will operate a temporary restricted service:

Staff will remain available on the phone during normal opening hours from Monday to Saturday should customers require assistance. 
Our showrooms will be open three days per week, on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, from 10.30am to 6.00pm.
Staff and customers are requested to maintain hand-hygiene regimes and social distancing, that is, leave at least 2 metres (6 feet) distance between themselves and other people. 
It is requested that children under the age of 16 are not brought to the showrooms while the temporary restricted service is operating. 

We continue to have high stock levels and we will operate a contactless home delivery and collection service for our customers.  Our delivery department will be happy to update you on contactless service and policies. These precautions are taken to assist in the fight against Covid-19 and to reduce transmission of the virus. 

Thank you for your co-operation and we wish good health to all our staff and customers.

Denis Cummins"
